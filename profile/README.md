# WebNode Ecosystem

A unified space for open-source tooling, SDKs, and infrastructure designed to support building websites as microservices. The organization focuses on delivering lightweight, composable, and scalable libraries that empower developers to create service-oriented web architectures.

## Mission

To provide consistent, modular tools and standards that simplify the development and deployment of distributed web applications. By adopting opinionated patterns and cohesive designs, the ecosystem encourages best practices, maintainability, and developer productivity.

## Scope

- SDKs for WebNode-based applications
- Shared configuration and utilities
- Internal developer tools and workflows
- Standardized conventions for microservice development

## Repository Structure

All SDKs, tools, and shared packages are centrally maintained across dedicated repositories. The `.github` repository contains GitHub-specific configuration, including the public profile.

## License

All repositories are licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
